## Current Rule

This workspace should prefer isolated vNext implementation over reuse.
Current/prototype structures are reference evidence only and are not accepted
inputs for exported core. The canonical persisted input is
`FlowDocPackage.packageVersion = 2` with `document.version = 3`. Any future
one-off converter must live outside exported core and outside required vNext
checks.

## Phase 10 Boundary

Current pagination/export work is vNext-only and now has both a planning
boundary and measured skeleton output:

- `buildVNextPaginationPlan(...)` produces page boxes, zone source order,
  source item split-policy hints, and measurement status.
- `paginateVNextDocument(...)` consumes the vNext plan and emits measured page
  fragments for body/static zones, forced page breaks, text-block line
  fragmentation, and basic page-number inline resolution.
- `measureVNextText(...)` defines the vNext text measurement boundary with
  stable cache keys, line boxes, measurement profiles, cache hit/miss metadata,
  and operation-driven cache invalidation.
- `columns` nodes now produce `widthShare`/gap-based container and child
  fragments instead of one opaque atomic fragment.
- `table` nodes now produce page-segment, row, cell, and measured text
  fragments with row-level page breaks and repeated header rows.
- over-tall breakable table rows whose cell children are text blocks now split
  by measured line ranges while `allowBreak=false` rows stay atomic and warn.
- table cell child policy is explicit for measured text, atomic spacer/divider,
  generated TOC, and ignored page-break nodes.
- `buildVNextMeasuredRendererConsumption(...)` converts measured fragments into
  renderer commands without accepting authored document input, and blocks when
  table fragments lack geometry, hierarchy, line-range, or table metadata.
- `assessVNextMeasuredPaginationExportReadiness(...)` reports ready,
  ready-with-warnings, or blocked from measured pagination warnings and
  renderer-consumption issues while preserving the no-relayout renderer
  contract.
- `docs/TABLE_PAGINATION_VNEXT_PLAN.md` locks the selected table direction as
  row-level pagination plus splittable cell text, with full table-engine work
  deferred until the B path is stable.
- `createApproximateVNextTextMeasurer(...)` provides deterministic measurement
  for tests and early local integration without importing the parent runtime.
- `buildVNextExportPlan(...)` declares that PDF and DOCX consume measured
  pagination output and must not relayout.
- `resolveVNextPaginationInvalidation(...)` maps operation results to stale or
  unchanged pagination/export readiness.

This phase does not import the parent layout engine, provide a renderer-backed
measurement profile implementation, split non-text table cell content across
pages, balance columns across multiple pages, finalize TOC page references, or
render PDF/DOCX beyond the measured-fragment consumption contract yet.

## Phase 9 Baseline

Current operation commands are graph-backed and canonical-only:

- `node.delete`
- `node.duplicate`
- `node.reorder`
- `columns.insert`
- `columns.layout.patch`
- `text-block.insert`
- `text-block.text.replace`
- `table.row.insert`
- `table.row.delete`
- `table.column.insert`
- `table.column.delete`

They return validation policy, history policy, render invalidation, and graph
scope metadata. `createVNextOperationHistoryRecord(...)` converts committed and
rejected operation results into JSON-serializable history-ready records.
`appendVNextOperationHistoryRecord(...)` and
`replayVNextOperationHistory(...)` provide an in-memory replay contract. This
does not persist durable operation history or integrate with the current editor
runtime yet.
